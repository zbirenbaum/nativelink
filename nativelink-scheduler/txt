Four Schedulers
Setup two bazel pointing at two different client
Two only service clients
Two backend schedulers only service worker

Worker should just talk to one scheduler
Later we can make workers talk to multiple schedulers
If the scheduler dies all the workers die with it

If you kill any scheduler
any client connected to the scheduler is killed
any scheduler 

One worker, two clients, two schedulers

Client 1 and Worker 1 connected to scheduler A
Client 2 connected to scheduler B

If you kill scheduler A, Client 2 should not know
If the worker was taking the work from 


Client 1 must start task 1 on scheduler 1
Client 2 will connect to different scheduler with same task and join's the other schedulers job.
